# AutoCaptaUwow

This was an attempted failure for creating a desktop UI and providing functionality with tesseract and the keyboard package over at npm.
All was well until i forgot to push close to 80 commits to origin when developing on windows. What is worse, this was all followed by a OS reinstall wiping all my work, blood and tears. Now i'll leave this empty repo here to remind myself to never do shit like that again.
